# case-scraper
Tennessee has several counties with websites that offer a free search engine to find public records of civil, criminal and traffic cases. A case is recorded in a countiesâ€™ database when a person is suspected of a crime.

We scrape the website for all cases in order to check if people are eligible for expungement, which is where their criminal record is cleared.
