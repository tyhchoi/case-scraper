# case-scraper
Tennessee has several counties (a geographic region of a state) with websites that offer a free search engine to find public records of civil, criminal and traffic cases. A case is recorded in a counties’ database when a person is suspected of a crime. So, if you were caught by police with possession of illegal drugs or committed theft, that information would be recorded publicly in some of Tennessee’s counties databases - public for anyone to view.
